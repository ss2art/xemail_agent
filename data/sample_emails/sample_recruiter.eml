Hi [Name],

I have a fully remote Python Developer opportunity with a SaaS company modernizing their data pipeline (Flask/FastAPI, Postgres, Celery, AWS). Team is US-based; they prefer candidates with experience in CI/CD and observability (Docker, GitHub Actions, Datadog).

Comp range: $140k–$165k base + bonus + equity. Start dates in November; interviews are 2 rounds (HM screen + tech exercise).

If interested, please send your latest resume, location, and work authorization. I can also share the full JD and architecture overview deck.

Thanks,
Emily Chen
Senior Recruiter, TechHire
