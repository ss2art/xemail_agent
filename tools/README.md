# Tools directory

Utilities intended for operational tasks (data downloads, issue helpers, CLI diagnostics). These are run directly with the root `.venv` Python or shell.

- `create_issues.sh`: helper to open GitHub issues from `issues.json` with support for labels/projects/assignees.

Development/CI helper scripts that maintain the repo (hooks, lint runners, etc.) live under `scripts/`.
