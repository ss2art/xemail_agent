    "title": "Quit control: Close browser tab and stop Streamlit server (Barebones + Full)",
    "body": "Implement a consistent quit UX that: (1) uses a two-step confirmation, (2) attempts to close the current browser tab via a small JS snippet (where the browser allows), and (3) stops the Streamlit server process cross-platform (Windows/PowerShell friendly) using a safe delayed os._exit(0).\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- Barebones: Replace current quit with two buttons: 'Close this tab' and 'Stop server'; document that some browsers may block window.close for non-script-opened tabs.\n- Full build: Add the same quit controls in the sidebar.\n- Works on Windows (Chrome/Edge/Firefox) without requiring Ctrl+C in the terminal.\n- Displays clear instructions if the tab cannot be closed automatically.\n- Tested locally; docs updated in README.",
